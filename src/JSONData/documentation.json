      "explanation": "Interfaces define a contract for what implementing classes must do, but they do not provide the implementation. Classes can implement one or more interfaces.

      "explanation": "Promises are used for handling asynchronous operations such as fetching data from a server, reading files, or performing animations. They simplify asynchronous code and avoid 'callback hell'. Promises can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected. They support chaining using 'then()' and 'catch()' methods. In the example, a new promise is created with an executor function that may resolve or reject the promise."

      "explanation": "Async/await is built on top of promises and provides a more readable and concise syntax for handling asynchronous operations. 'async' functions return promises implicitly, and 'await' pauses the execution of the function until the promise is resolved or rejected. Async/await makes error handling with try-catch blocks straightforward. In the example, 'fetchData' is an async function that fetches data from an API and handles any errors."

      "description": "Inheritance is a feature of C++ that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.",
      "example": "class ChildClass : public ParentClass {\n    // child class definition\n};",
      "explanation": "Inheritance enables code reuse and promotes the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes. C++ supports single, multiple, and hierarchical inheritance. Derived classes (also known as subclasses or child classes) inherit members from their base classes (also known as superclasses or parent classes). In the example, 'ChildClass' inherits from 'ParentClass', meaning 'ChildClass' inherits all public and protected members of 'ParentClass'."

      "description": "Polymorphism is a feature of C++ that allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common superclass.",
      "example": "// example of polymorphism\nAnimal *animal = new Dog();\nanimal->eat();",
      "explanation": "Polymorphism enables flexibility and extensibility in the design of C++ programs. It allows for code that operates on objects of a superclass to be reused with objects of its subclasses. C++ supports two types of polymorphism: compile-time (static) polymorphism and runtime (dynamic) polymorphism. In the example, 'animal' can refer to any object that is a subclass of 'Animal', such as a 'Dog' or 'Cat' object."

      "example": "template <class T>\nT add(T a, T b) {\n    return a + b;\n}",
      "explanation": "Templates in C++ enable writing code that operates on any data type. They allow for the creation of generic algorithms and data structures that can be used with different data types without code duplication. Templates are instantiated with specific data types at compile time, and the compiler generates the appropriate code for each instantiation. In the example, 'add()' is a template function that adds two values of type 'T'."

      "explanation": "The STL provides several components, including containers (such as vectors, lists, and maps), algorithms (such as sorting and searching), and iterators (for traversing containers). STL containers and algorithms are highly efficient and provide a wide range of functionality for common programming tasks. In the example, a vector of integers is reversed using the 'reverse()' algorithm."

      "explanation": "C++ provides classes and functions for performing file I/O operations. File streams (such as 'ifstream' for input and 'ofstream' for output) are used to open files, read from them, and write to them. C++ file I/O operations are performed using stream operators ('<<' for output and '>>' for input). Files must be closed using the 'close()' method after use to release system resources. In the example, a file named 'file.txt' is opened for reading."

      "example": "try {\n    // code that may throw an exception\n}\ncatch (const std::exception& e) {\n    // code to handle the exception\n}",
      "explanation": "C++ provides a robust exception handling mechanism using the 'try', 'catch', 'throw', and 'finally' blocks. Exceptions are objects that are thrown when an error occurs during program execution. C++ provides standard exception classes (such as 'std::exception' and its subclasses) for different types of errors. Exception handling allows you to gracefully handle errors and prevent program crashes. In the example, code that may throw an exception is enclosed in a 'try' block, and the corresponding exception handling code is written in the 'catch' block."

      "explanation": "Namespaces are used to avoid naming collisions between different parts of a program. They allow for creating separate scopes for identifiers and organizing code into logical units. Namespaces can contain variables, functions, classes, and other namespaces. Namespaces are particularly useful when working with libraries or large codebases to avoid conflicts between identifiers. In the example, 'Math' is a namespace containing an 'add()' function."

      "explanation": "Pointers in C++ are used for dynamic memory allocation, passing parameters by reference, and building data structures such as linked lists and trees. The 'address-of' operator '&' is used to obtain the memory address of a variable, and the dereference operator '*' is used to access the value stored at a memory address. Pointers can be of different types, such as integer pointers, character pointers, or void pointers. In the example, 'ptr' is a pointer to an integer variable 'x'."

It is part of the C++ language specification and is available in all conforming C++ implementations. The Standard Library is extensive and covers a wide range of programming needs, allowing developers to write efficient and portable code. In the example, the 'iostream' header is included to use 'cout' for output."
